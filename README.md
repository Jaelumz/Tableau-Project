# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
To generate insights by employing diverse visualizations and dashboards, utilizing data on real estate prices and incomes across select districts in Canada. Through these insights, stakeholders and end users can gain a deeper understanding of the fluctuations in real estate prices across various Canadian districts over the years. Additionally, they can assess how these changes correspond to shifts in earnings throughout the same period. Here is the procedural approach for achieving these goals.

## Process
Following my assessment of the project task, I focused on option1; understanding the project's objectives and anticipated insights.
- Initial step involved downloading the provided datasets; following that, all datasets (CSV and JSON file) uploaded to Tableau.
- Subsequent task involved conducting exploratory analysis on the datasets to grasp the data and its datatypes. This also entailed checking for any missing values or necessary manipulations to prepare the data for visualization.
- Next steps entailed executing data transformations, using calculated fields to extract specific insights from the data.
- To address project objective, optimal visualizations were utilized to provide desired insights to consumers of the report.


## Results
- Utilizing all datasets to generate insights and trend analysis for decision-makers, the below chart types were used to showcase needed insights:
  - Line Chart
  - Area Chart
  - Bar Plots
  - Highlight Table

From analysis of the data and modelling relationships, the following conclusions were drawn:
- The price of homes and offices have consistently risen over the last 40 years, with the most significant surge occuring between 1983 and 1984.
- The Canadian districts with the highest priced homes are Greater Vancouver, Lower Mainland and Oakville Milton. The price difference of homes in these districts has remained relatively consistent; however, earnings across Canada have exhibited a steady annual growth rate.
- There is no discernible difference between the Consumer Price Index and House Price Index over the years. Both indices have grown at the same rate.
- In 2001, Canadians allocated over 150% of their incomes to home expenses. However, by 2014, this proportion significantly decreased to slightly over 50%. Although no direct correlation has been observed between key economic events in the past and incomes or real estate prices in Canada. However, a subtle relationship exists with the prices of house construction, notably with a dip in the cost of construction materials during those pivotal years.

## Challenges 
Challenges faced entailed:
- Difficulties importing the JSON file into Tableau, resulting in an inaccurate table. This was addressed this by importing the file into Python, utilizing pandas to convert it into a dataframe, and subsequently exporting it to CSV.
- Limitations encountered in accessing specific charts needed to optimally provide visualization to support insights.

## Future Goals
Improve my data interpretation and modelling skills to build more relationships using Tableau
